# Predicting Mobile Phone Prices with Random Forest

## Description

This project focuses on predicting mobile phone prices using the Random Forest algorithm. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a model that accurately forecasts the prices of mobile devices based on various features such as specifications, brand, and market trends.

- Utilized a Random Forest algorithm to analyze mobile phone data and predict prices.
- Gathered and processed extensive datasets comprising mobile phone specifications and historical pricing information.
- Employed feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance and accuracy.
- Conducted rigorous testing and evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the predictive model.

## Outcome

Developed a robust predictive model capable of accurately estimating mobile phone prices, providing valuable insights for both consumers and industry professionals.
